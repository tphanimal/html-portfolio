<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey there! My name is Tony Phan. I currently reside in Austin, TX and have beening living here for almsot 4 years!</p>

<p>On my free time, I like to go on hikes with my dog, Zoe. She is the sweetest Golden Retriever! I'm also a car fanatic. My dream cars are a JZA70 Supra, E92 M3 BMW, and a 240z Nissan.</p>

<p>Professionally, I have been in the Tech field for 2+ years. I work in the Marketing Department and it's a blast every day! My hopes are going into a Dev position as I find this work really rewarding and fun.</p>
